## Kelton Chapter 5 Problems


### 5.7.1

**What is the difference between object property and object state?**


- **Object properties** are input values that can be specified when we instantiate an object and does not change during simulation.
- **Object states** are dynamic values associated with the object runspace and can change during simulatin run.

***


### 5.7.2

**Consider a process associated with a Server object. What is the difference between a token's *parent* object and its *associated* object?**


In a process associated with a Server object the token's *parent* object is the server itself and the *associted* object is the entity that triggers the process to execute.

### 5.7.3

**Develop a queueing model that gives the steady-state values analogous to the values in Table 5.2 (Model 5-1 with expotential processing times at both stations).**

### 5.7.4

*Results*

Run the created simio model for 8 hours (9:00am to 5:00pm) with 25 replication unsing transfer node method discussed on week 4 discussion to distribute the customers to the three written exam terminals and goth the following result:

### 5.7.5

*Animation*

Following is a screen shot of the animation for problem 5.7.4, I have used the default value of 1.4 meter per second for entity speed which is the average walking speed for human. The .spx file was submitted via blackbord.
